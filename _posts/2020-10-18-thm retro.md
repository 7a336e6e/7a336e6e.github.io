# TryHackMe - Retro
A write-up to the Retro machine provided by [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/). This machine is part of the `Offensive Pentesting` learning path from THM in the `Extra Credit` Section being rated as a `Hard` difficulty.... Let's get to it.

Not much to see in this scan... only 2 ports open. Going on port 80 we see a basic Windows IIS Webpage... but from the machine description we already know there's a hidden directory somewhere... so we're going to fire up gobuster and see what we can find

```

/retro (Status: 301)
```

So we have a `retro` directory... With a quick scroll we can see / know the following:
- it's a wordpress blog -> there's a `/wp-login.php` link in the footer
- there's a user `Wade` which will most likely be our way in

There's 2 ways to actually get in this user account.

## Brute force the credentials
We already know the user is `Wade` we just have to find the right password. Either use `rockyou.txt` and wait however long 'till it finds the good password or use `cewl` to generate a custom password list.

## More recon...
Since `cewl` gets us the good password also it means that somwhere on this blog that password is written down somehow... So we have to look around for it. To be honest I really didn't feel like having a long lecture about retro games but I randomly clicked on one post and then I saw something __interesting__

Wade commented on one of the posts `Ready Player One` and if we look there he just left a random __note to self__ with the word `parzival`. 


# Foothold
Foothold was a bit interesting since I started up on a path that I normally take when seeing wordpress apps... I logged in with `Wade:parzival` credentials and went straight for the theme editor. with the help of [PenTest.WS](https://pentest.ws/) I created a `php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp` php shell that I manually added in the `404.php` page. Started a Metasploit TCP Listener and just went to a random link to get the 404 page. It worked... I'm in... something... I got in the user under which the web application was running

```
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (10.11.14.38:9090 -> 10.10.75.210:52759) at 2020-10-18 22:10:13 +0300

meterpreter > getuid
Server username: IUSR (0)
meterpreter > sysinfo
Computer    : RETROWEB
OS          : Windows NT RETROWEB 10.0 build 14393 (Windows Server 2016) i586
Meterpreter : php/windows

```

After about 30 minutes of trying stuff, trying to break out from this user and into `Wade` I realized there's something I didn't try... One common issue with users is `password reuse`, so if he was using that password for his wordpress account... what else could he used it for ?

Since this is a Windows machine I'm going to use `xfreerdp` to try and connect into this machine as `Wade`
```
xfreerdp /u:wade /v:10.10.75.210
```
It worked! we're in.

From here on you can pretty much upload a meterpreter shell to benefit from the post exploitation modules within `Metasploit` and either get the flag now from RDP or get it after from meterpreter.
